## About the Hackathon

Welcome to the research hackathon on knowledge engineering with prompt engineering! The hackathon will bring together researchers and practitioners with an interest in using the latest advances in pre-trained language models (PLMs) and generative AI to create and maintain curated, credible, and trustworthy knowledge graphs.

The hackathon is designed as a collaborative, interdisciplinary sprint-style research activity, in which participants will work in teams to prototype new ideas, methods, tools, and evaluation frameworks around the use of PLMs to produce, access, and share knowledge that people can trust. The gathering is meant to kick-start an interdisciplinary community of interest and practice in deploying advanced AI capabilities to support people in engineering better knowledge graphs for trustworthy, human-centric information services, from search and question answering to recommendations and fact checking.

Participating teams will choose from among a series of curated topics, which include:
- Using PLMs to support specialised knowledge engineering tasks such as generating competency questions, evaluating knowledge graphs from an ontological perspective, aligning across knowledge graphs and their underlying schemas, extracting rich knowledge structures beyond simple entities and relations
- Understanding the benefits and limitations of conversational affordances (e.g., ChatGPT) as an alternative to established knowledge graph editing paradigms with respect to usability, task performance, and the ability to gain and maintain user trust.
- Methods to ensure human-in-the-loop knowledge base construction is transparent, accountable, fair, and compliant with emerging AI laws and regulations.

Places are limited to around 30 participants. While we expect this will be of interest to graduate students or postdocs, we welcome anyone with practical, hands-on experience in applying technologies such as prompt engineering, ontology engineering, and information extraction.

This hackathon came out of discussions at the Dagstuhl Seminar on "Knowledge Graphs and their Role in the Knowledge Engineering of the 21st Century" held in September 2022. The report of this seminar is available [here](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2023/17810/).
