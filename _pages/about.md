Welcome to the Knowledge Engineering Research Hackathon! In this research hackathon, participants will work together in groups to develop new ideas, methods, tools, and evaluation frameworks around the use of large language models for knowledge engineering (LLMKE). This is an open-ended goal that includes topics such as, but not limited to: LLM-based knowledge graph construction, linkage, and completion; ontology and schema engineering through LLMs; knowledge-graph based prompt engineering; LLM enrichment via KGs; data stories and data science workflows with LLMs and KGs; etc. This event is a great opportunity to learn new skills, connect with like-minded researchers, and make an impact in the field of knowledge engineering.

## Motivation

Large language models (LLMs) like GPT, LaMDA, and BERT and derived conversational agents such as ChatGPT have revolutionized the field of natural language processing by providing powerful tools for a wide range of tasks such as language generation, machine translation, and question answering. Great enthusiasm has been ignited on using the benchmark-passing output from LLMs for a variety of tasks, and researchers have started exploring the potential of LLMs for knowledge engineering. Knowledge engineering is the process of developing knowledge-based systems, such as expert systems, ontologies and knowledge graphs that can reason and make decisions based on domain-specific knowledge.  The use of LLMs can help to automatically extract information and construct knowledge graphs at scale, potentially enabling new applications and insights; but also to amend and complete their contents, enrich their ontologies and schemas, leverage collaborative approaches, etc. However, there are also challenges and limitations to consider, such as the quality and completeness of the LLMs from which knowledge graphs are built, as well as ethical concerns around data privacy, environmental impact, and bias.
