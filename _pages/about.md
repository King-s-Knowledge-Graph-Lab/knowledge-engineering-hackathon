<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Welcome to the Knowledge Engineering Research Hackathon! In this research led hackathon, participants will work together to explore and leverage the latest technologies, including large language models, to construct effective and efficient knowledge graphs. This event is a great opportunity to learn new skills, connect with like-minded researchers, and make an impact in the field of knowledge engineering.

## Motivation

Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and ChatGPT have revolutionized the field of natural language processing by providing powerful tools for a wide range of tasks such as language generation, machine translation, and question answering. Great enthusiasm have been ignited on adopting the rich common sense knowledge inside LLMs and researchers have started exploring the potential of LLMs for knowledge engineering. Knowledge engineering is the process of developing knowledge-based systems, such as expert systems, and knowledge graphs, that can reason and make decisions based on domain-specific knowledge.  The use of LLMs can help to automatically extract information and construct knowledge graphs at scale, potentially enabling new applications and insights. However, there are also challenges and limitations to consider, such as the quality and completeness of the constructed knowledge graphs, as well as ethical concerns around data privacy and bias.
